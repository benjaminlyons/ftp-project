Simple FTP server and client with tests.

It's not meant to actually be used, I just made it to help refresh my networking and C abilities.

TODO:
1. Consider adding a status code so the client knows if the command worked or not (This really needs to happen)
2. Consider adding the 'cat' command (should be very easy)
3. Consider making it encrypted.
